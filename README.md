# 📊 Simple Calculator in C

This project is a simple calculator written in C, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two integer numbers. The code is interactive, prompting the user to choose an operation and input numbers for the calculation.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Supported Operations:** Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
- **Input Validation:** Checks if the entered operators are valid and if the numbers are integers.
- **Error Handling:** Provides feedback on invalid inputs and prevents division by zero.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Compile the code with GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -g3 calculator.c -o calculator.exe
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./calculator.exe
   ```

## 🛠 Requirements

- **GCC Compiler:** To compile the code (MinGW on Windows).
- **Terminal:** To execute the compiled program.

## 📚 Technologies Used

- C Programming Language
- GCC Compiler (MinGW for Windows)

## 📜 Notes

- Ensure to input integers and use valid operators.
- Division by zero is handled to prevent runtime errors.
